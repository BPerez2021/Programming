This, at the beginning, was a rather complex project, but once I began I got the hang of the insructions with the help and clarification of my peers.
I appreciated the in class time to work on the assignment.
I enjoyed playing with the code to make the object do crazy things, from going backwards to accidentally having it fight against new code and previously presented code.
I helped peers when I could, helping relearn what I had already executed. The interesting part was trying to figure out when the code went differently on my peers projects compared to mine.
During this assignment, I proved to be very forgetful as seen in the noted throughout the assignment when I had the code but didnt place it in the draw portion.
