LAB TWO

When I first began the project at home there were many struggles.
I couldn't open items properly. Pip did not want to open. The file itsself, downloaded from Github, did not want to translate.
I was easily confused my everything. And just overall couldn't focus or understand what was required.
A few classmates were planning to meet before class, so I joined them, having asked my boss if I could leave work earlier than normal.
I figured maybe collective minds could work somewhat to fix any major issues with opening and setting up and at least help get me started.
In the end the main issues with setting up were fixed with the help of my peers.

During the actual process, there were some mixed up steps as well as errors with codes. 
The lab computers did also have some limiting factors.
Once getting past the set up and the first task, a flow and mindset understanding were made, allowing for easier flow of process.

Going into class, alot of issues were talked out and the one task-the longest sentences- were walked through.
Tuples were explained which helped alot (notes are at the bottom of the Lab)
The largest struggle, even in class, was applying the sorted list. 
After getting a second set of eyes to look at my last task's code, 
I realized I had forgotten to name a variable to the code that sorts the list.

My overall favorite portion of the project was selecting the number of intergers using the list[:-5] or list[-5:]. 
I don't even particularly know why I found this appealing.
