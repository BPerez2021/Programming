Dungeons and Dragons Character Generator

Summary:
A random character generator for Dungeon and Dragons players or DM's (for their NPCs), a character developer that randomizes the player's 
characteristics including race, class, origin etc. I love the characters and D&D's world allows for so many combinations due to their
categories. Having played a bit in undergrad, it took a while creating the character, when, as a novice, I wanted to play, so this generator
could allow the opportunity for novice players to make a quick character they could play as an introductory character.



Features:
-calculates character's stats: strength, dexterity, constitution, intellegence, wisdom, charisma, armor class, and initive
-presented on a stylized  background and text
-may present visual (depending on time and ability)
